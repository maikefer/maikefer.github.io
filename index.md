## Maike Rees
Hi, let me introduce myself. I'm a 25 years young enthusiastic Computer Science student based in southern Germany. I'm in my fourth semester of my master's degree with a strong focus on artificial intelligence and a smaller focus on software engineering. Currently, I'm figuring out the details of my master's thesis which will be in the field of **explainability of deep neural networks and its application to heart arrythmia localization based on ECG signals**. 

I have worked at Porsche AG doing research on autonomous driving. I did my bachelor's thesis in silicon vally at Volkswagen Group of America Electronics Research Lab about **Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving**.

My main interests are machine learning and computer vision, especially their application in medicine and automotive. 
I also like: scientific writing, accesability, clean code standards, teaching.

Last semester I have been writing small essays about _Artefact Detection in EEG signals for Brain Computer Interfaces_ (also did a lot of implementations) and _A Survey on Neural Network Initialization Methods_. I also coded a Eclipse-Plugin to enable NLP-analysis of textfiles. You can find according code in my github profile, as well are old university projects (I've learned a lot since I wrote these lines of code ;-)). Sadly, a couple of current projects are confident. 

In my free time I swim, run, dance (salsa and bachata) and lift weights. I also volunteer extensively at my Lifesaving Club (DLRG - Deutsche-Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft), especially teaching kids how to swim and teaching trainers how to teach. I also enjoy traveling a lot.

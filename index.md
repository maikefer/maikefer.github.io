## Nice to meet you!
That's me - Maike Rees, a 24 years young enthusiastic Computer Science student based in southern Germany. Here is an incomplete list of my interests: Machine learning, anomaly detection, adversarial attacks, robustness of neural networks, computer vision, speech recognition and language undestanding, clean and pretty code, autonomous cars, robots of all kindss, black coffee, good books, organizational development of voluntary clubs, swimming, salsa and bachata dancing, running and (really important) traveling.  

I'm always searching for interesting papers, smart people to talk to, cool talks and meet ups a≈Ñd new ideas of all sorts. I've been to a lot of great places in this beautiful world, including a sparse mountain village in the middle of nowhere in Nepal, vivid Silicon Valley, beautiful Canada and most recently to the absolutely underrated Baltic States (really, go there!!). Always happy about travel recommendations!

## What I'm doing
Unfortunately, most things I'm currently working on are confidential. I've written my Bachelor's thesis about The _Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving_ at the Volkswagen Group of America's Electronics Research Lab in sunny California and I'm currently a working student at Porsche AG, doing R&D on highly autonomous (beautiful and fast) cars.

## Things to Read / Listen to
*   I was speaking at the _Machine Learning Student Talk_ of the University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe on the 22nd of October about my Bachelor Thesis
*   I haven't published any papers yet, but am waiting for their acceptance 


Stay tuned!

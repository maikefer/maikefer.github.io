Hi, let me introduce myself. I'm a 26 years young enthusiastic Computer Science student based in southern Germany. I'm in my fourth semester of my master's degree with a strong focus on artificial intelligence and a smaller focus on software engineering as well as robotics.

Until recently, I have worked at Porsche AG doing research on autonomous driving. I did my bachelor's thesis in silicon vally at Volkswagen Group of America Electronics Research Lab about **Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving**.

Currently, I'm writing my master's thesis with the topic "Analysis of the Explainability of a Deep Learning Algorithm for the Localization of Ventricular Ectopic Foci based on Body Surface Potential Maps." at the Insitute of Biomedical engineering (IBT) at the KIT. Besides, I have a small position as student research assistent at the Institute of Applied Materials (IAM-WK), researching and implementing automated defect detection in X-Ray images of manufacturing parts.

My main interests are machine learning and computer vision, especially their application in medicine and automotive. 
I also like: scientific writing, accesability, clean code standards and teaching.

Last semester I have written small essays about _Artefact Detection in EEG signals for Brain Computer Interfaces_ (also did a lot of implementations) and _A Survey on Neural Network Initialization Methods_. I also coded an Eclipse-Plugin to enable NLP-analysis of text files. You can find the according code in my github profile, as well as old university projects (I've learned a lot since I wrote these lines of code ;-)). Sadly, a couple of current projects are confident. 

In my free time I swim, run, dance (salsa and bachata), lift weights, read and do yoga. I also volunteer extensively at my Lifesaving Club (DLRG - Deutsche-Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft), especially teaching kids how to swim, teaching students the skills of life saving and teaching trainers how to teach their students. I also enjoy traveling a lot.

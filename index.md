## Maike Rees
Hi, let me introduce myself. I'm a 25 years young enthusiastic Computer Science student based in southern Germany. I'm in my third semester of my Master's degree with focus on artificial intelligence. I'm a working student at Porsche AG doing research on autonomous driving. I did my bachelor's thesis in silicon vally at Volkswagen Group of America's Electronics Research Lab about _Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving_.

My main interests are machine learning and computer vision, especially their application in medicine and automotive and accessability. 
I also like: scientific writing, accesability, clean code standards, teaching.

This semester I'm writing small essays about
- Artefact Detection in EEG signals for Brain Computer Interfaces,
- A Survey on Neural Network Initialization Methods and
- A Survey about Web Accessability through Content Management Systems.
I'm also coding an eclipse plugin that let's you analyse text. 

The code in my github profile are old university projects since recent projects are all confident. I've learned a lot since I wrote these lines of code ;-)

In my free time I swim, dance (salsa and bachata) and lift weights. I also volunteer a lot at my Lifesaving Club (DLRG - Deutsche-Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft), especially teaching kids how to swim and teaching trainers how to teach. I also enjoy traveling a lot.

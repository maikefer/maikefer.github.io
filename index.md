## Nice to meet you!
That's me - Maike Rees, a 25 years young enthusiastic Computer Science student based in southern Germany where I'm in the middle of my Masters degree with focus on cognitive systems and software development. 

Here is an incomplete list of my interests: machine learning, computer vision, speech recognition and language undestanding, clean and pretty code, autonomous cars, robots of all kinds, black coffee, good books, organizational development of voluntary clubs, swimming, salsa and bachata dancing, running, lifting weights and traveling.  

## What I'm doing
Unfortunately, most things I'm currently working on are confidential, only some very old university projects are tumbling around my github profil. I've written my bachelor's thesis about The _Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving_ at the Volkswagen Group of America's Electronics Research Lab in sunny California and I'm currently a working student at Porsche AG, doing R&D on highly autonomous (beautiful and fast) cars.
